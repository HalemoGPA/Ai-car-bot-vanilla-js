# AI Car Bot - Vanilla JS

This project showcases a self-driving car simulation built using vanilla JavaScript, with no external libraries. It employs neural networks to simulate the decision-making process of a self-driving car.

## Features

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: The project uses pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Neural Networks**: Implements basic neural networks for decision-making.
- **Sensor Simulation**: Simulates car sensors for obstacle detection.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of the car, road, and sensors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HalemoGPA/Ai-car-bot-vanilla-js.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Ai-car-bot-vanilla-js
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

- Open `index.html` to start the simulation.
- The car will attempt to drive itself using the implemented neural network.
- Modify the JavaScript files to adjust the car's behavior and neural network parameters.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `main.css`: The stylesheet for the project.
- `main.js`: The entry point for the JavaScript code.
- `car.js`: Contains the Car class.
- `controls.js`: Manages user inputs.
- `road.js`: Handles road rendering and logic.
- `sensor.js`: Simulates car sensors.
- `network.js`: Implements the neural network.
- `visualizer.js`: Visualizes the neural network.
